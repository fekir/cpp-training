== `enum class`

`enum` makes it possible to define integral values with meaningful names, without defining constants and giving them a separate type.

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
enum status {open, closed};

void foo(status s);

foo(open);
foo(closed);
foo(42); // does not compile
----

=== `enum class`

The downsides of `enum` is that it is "global", as it is not possible to reuse the identifier in other places.
It also converts implicitely to other integral types:

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
enum status {open, closed};

bool closed = false; // does not compile
open + closed; // compiles
----


[%notitle]
=== `enum class`

`enum class` shares many of the properties of an `enum`, but

  * introduces a new scope
  * does not convert implicitely to integral types

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
enum class status {open, closed};

void foo(status s);

foo(status::open);
foo(status::closed);
foo(42); // does not compile

bool closed = false; // compiles
status::open + status::closed; // does not compile
----


[%notitle]
=== `enum class`

For both `enum` and `enum class` it is possible to cast an integral value to an enumeration type.
But if the produced value is not within the range of the enumeration values, then the behaviour is undefined.
