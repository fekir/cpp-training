== FAQ about move

=== Is it possible to write a copy constructor that takes by non-const reference or a move constructor that can throw?

Yes.
Such code should be banned.

`auto_ptr` is one of those rare types that has been *removed* from {cpp}, and it did not work correctly in many situations.

=== I wrote `std::move(a)`, why did `a` 's value not change?

Because moving from an object a can modify its value, but doesnâ€™t have to.
This is the same as any other non-const operation on a.

=== Is the "moved-from" state special?

The state of a variable after it has been moved from is just as special as the state after any other non-const operation.

=== What does "valid but unspecified state" mean?

The object continues to be a valid object of its type, its value might or might not have been modified.
The standard library specifies this guarantee for all standard types.
There are no garantuees for user-defined types.

All well-behaved types should probably do the same.

=== Does "but unspecified" mean the object's invariants might not hold?

If any function on an object makes it invalid, probably the function has a bug, or the class does not have the supposed invariant.

In {cpp}, an object is valid (meets its invariants) for its entire lifetime, which is from the end of its construction to the start of its destruction.

Moving from an object does not end its lifetime, only destruction does.

=== Does "moved-from" correspond to "partially formed" described in Elements of Programming (EoP)?

No, EoP requires such objects only to be assignable and destroyable.
The {cpp} standard makes a broader statement: "operations on the object behave as specified for its type" and a moved-from object "must still meet the requirements of the library component that is using it."

=== What can I do with a moved-from object?

Some classes documents a moved-from state (like `std::unique_ptr`), but generally only operations without preconditions are allowed.

Especially in generic code, only operations like destruction, or somehow resettings the state of the object are sensible operations.
The standard library in practice follows the "partially formed" definition from EoP, because there are generally no other sensible operations to do.
