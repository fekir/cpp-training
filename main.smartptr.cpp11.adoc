Smart Pointers

[%notitle]
== smart ptr

{cpp}11 introduces `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr` and deprecates `std::auto_ptr`.

This are for ease the management of memory and other resources.

They remove the need to write custom destructors for nearly all use cases.

== Smart pointers are owning pointers

Smart pointers are "owning" pointers.
They release the resources they point to.
If you do not own the resource, use a "naked" pointer, a reference or make a copy.

== What is a `unique_ptr`

`std::unique_ptr` models exclusive ownership:

	* std::unique_ptr owns the raw pointer
	* there can't be a second owner (unless misuse)

ownership can be passed to another `unique_pointer` by moving


=== Example

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
struct s{ int i = 42; };

void foo(){
  std::unique_ptr<s> uptr0;
  {
    auto ptr = new s();
    auto uptr1 = std::unique_ptr<s>(ptr);
    //uptr0 = uptr1; // copy is a comp-time eror
    uptr0 = std::move(uptr1); // moves pointer from uptr1 to uptr0
  }
}
----

=== `unique_ptr` models onwership, not only memory ownersip

The owner calls `delete` by default, but it is possible to use other deleters too.

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
struct file_deleter {
    void operator()(std::FILE* fp) { std::fclose(fp); }
};
using unique_file = std::unique_ptr<std::FILE, file_deleter>;

auto f = unique_file(std::fopen("file.txt", "rw") );
----


== `unique_ptr` has been designed in a way to be easy to integrate in older code-basis

=== No overhead

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
static_assert(
	sizeof(T*) == sizeof(std::unique_ptr<T>), 
	"size differs"
)
----

No allocations, or other operation that could fail.
Direct access to owned pointer.

=== Behaves like a pointer

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
struct bar{void foo(){};};

auto pb = new bar();
auto upb = std::make_unique<bar>();

pb->foo();
upb->foo();

if(pb){}
if(pb == nullptr){}

if(upb){}
if(upb == nullptr){}

bar& b = *pb;
bar& ub = *upb;
----

=== It is possible to `.release()` ownership

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
struct bar{};

auto uptr std::make_unique<bar>();
auto ptr = uptr.release();
// uptr now stores nullptr
delete ptr;
----


== Example usage for string class

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
class string {
	size_t size;
	std::unique_ptr<char[]> data;

 public:
	explicit string(const char* p) :
	 size(strlen(p)+1), data(std::make_unique<char[]>(size)) {
		memcpy(data, p, size);
	}
	// no need to implement ~string

	string(const string& that) :
	 size(that.size), data(std::make_unique<char[]>(size)) {
		memcpy(data, that.data, size);
	}

	string& operator=(string that) {
		std::swap(data, that.data);
		std::swap(size, that.size);
		return *this;
	}

	// move semantic is for free, but as we have implemented copy-op,
	// we need to tell the compiler to implement them
	string(string&& that) noexcept = default;
	string& operator=(string&& that) noexcept = default;
};
----

=== If you need a container prefer vector

While both constructs can be used to represent zero, one or more elements, the interface of `std::vector` is less error-prone.

Also notice that `std::string` is generally https://github.com/elliotgoodrich/SSO-23/blob/master/README.md[more performant] than `std::vector`.

Moral of the story: do not implement string from scratch, prefer `std::string` to `std::wstring`.

== Replacing naked owning pointer in existing code

As `unique_ptr` has an interface similar to a normal pointer, it is possible to replace the usage of naked pointers with `unique_ptr` iteratively.
If the semantic of a construct is simple, then the operation is trivial, as errors are diagnosed by the compiler.


[%notitle]
=== Replacing naked owning pointer in existing code

Generally removing the usage of naked owning pointers

	* documents better who owns the resource
	* permits the compiler to validate our assumptions, and diagnose errors
	* simplifies code in unexpected ways


=== Clearing containers

before

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
	for( std::vector<T*>::iterator it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it ){
		delete *it;
	}
	vec.clear();
----

after

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
	vec.clear();

or even

=== Inserting new elements in containers

before

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
struct foo {
	using internal_map = std::map<std::string, I*>;
	using external_map = std::map<std::string, internal_map>;
	external_map m_map;

	~foo() {
		for ( auto it = m_map.begin(); it != m_map.end(); ++it ) {
			for ( auto subIt = it->second.begin(); subIt != it->second.end(); ++subIt ) {
				delete subIt->second;
			}
		}

	void bar(const std::string& str1, const std::string& str2, I* i) {
		auto it = m_map.find(str1);
		if ( it != m_map.end() ) {
			auto subIt = it->second.find(str2);
			if ( subIt != it->second.end() ) {
				delete subIt->second;
			}
			it->second[str2] = i;
		} else {
			internal_map imap;
			imap[str2] = i;
			m_map[str1] = imap;
		}
	}
}

	// ...
};

== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leaks

Without `unique_ptr` or similar alternatives

	* enlist every place where a resource is allocated
	* track where handles to the resources are passed
	* verify that every resource is closed only once
	* verify that the correct function for closing the resource is used

It's hard and error prone to apply those guidelines consistently

[%notitle]
=== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leaks

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
C* foo();
----

Should we free/close the return value of `foo`.
Do we own it?
If yes, how?

=== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leaks

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
void bar(C*);
void foo(){
	auto i = new C();
	bar(i);

Is it correct that no delete takes place?
Does it happen inside `bar`?

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
void bar(C*);
void foo(){
	auto i = new C();
	bar(i);
	delete i;

----

Is `i` always released?
If not, is it correct?
//If yes, is it by design or accident?

void foo() {
	auto i = new C();
	try {
		bar(i);
	} catch (...) {
		delete i;
		throw;
	}
	delete i;
}
----

Is very verbose and error-prone.

void bar(C*, C*);
void foo() {
	auto i = new C();
	try {
		auto j = new C();
		try {
			bar(i, j);
		} catch (...) {
			delete j;
			throw;
		}
		delete j;
	} catch (...) {
		delete i;
		throw;
	}
	delete i;
}
----

It does not scale, no-one writes code like that.
Imagine a function or constructor with 3 parameters.
//Every language without destructor has similar issues.

[%notitle]
=== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leak

Similar difficulties exists when implementing a class that owns more than one resource

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
struct X {
	C* i;
	C* j;
	explicit X():
	 i(new C()),
	 j(new C()) {
	}

	~X(){
		delete j;
		delete i;
	}
};
----

Fixing `X` without using helper classes is left as exercise to the reader.

== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leaks

With `unique_ptr` or similar constructs

	* Newer use non-owning handles
	* verify if and where `.release()` is used, as it is equivalent to managing memory manually.

Which is ideally equivalent to

	* Do not handle resources manually

[%notitle]
=== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leaks

If memory is not managed manually:

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
std::unique_ptr<C> foo();
----

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
C* foo();
----

In both cases, from the function signature its clear if we own the returned value or not.
In both cases, calling `foo()` does not cause any leak by design.

[%notitle]
=== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leaks

If memory is not managed manually:

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
void bar(std::unique_ptr<C>);
void foo(){
	auto ptr = std::make_unique<C>();
	bar(std::move(ptr));
}
----

or

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
void bar(C*);
void foo(){
	auto ptr = std::make_unique<C>();
	bar(ptr.get());
}
----

then it's clear if `bar` takes ownership of the parameter or not.

In both cases, there is no need to track about who owns the pointer.
It also scales well, as the written code does not depend on the number of possible execution paths.
//The compiler does it for us (unless calling `.release()`).
//Also no need to think about exceptions.

[%notitle]
=== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leaks

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
struct X {
	std::unique_ptr<C> i;
	std::unique_ptr<C> j;
	explicit X() :
	 i(std::make_unique<C>()) ,
	 j(std::make_unique<C>()) {
	}
	// ~X is compiler-generated
};
----

`X` is leak-free.

As a corollary of the single-responsibility principle:
A class should own directly only one resource.

[%notitle]
=== Rules of thumbs for avoiding leak

`.release()` is mostly necessary when working with external or C libraries, as we cannot change those functions to use `unique_ptr`.

It is possible to wrap/hide those functions (which are a small subset of the code we control) and make them work with `unique_ptr` too.

Supposing that third-party code is correct, it possible to keep track of places where `.release()` is needed to a very limited subset of code, and ensure the absence of leaks with a `grep`.

== shared_ptr

Did not talk much about `std::shared_ptr` and `std::weak_ptr` because there are not as many use cases as with `std::unique_ptr`.

[%notitle]
=== shared_ptr

It has a copy constructor, every copy increments a thread-safe counter:

	* it is more difficult, if possible, to understand who owns the resource
	* can cause leaks with circular dependencies
	* has overhead compared to a naked pointer
	* the synchronisation is costly if not needed
	* it is trivial to convert an `unique_ptr` to a `shared_ptr`, generally impossible to do the opposite

// FIXME: add performance example
[%notitle]
=== shared_ptr

Nevertheless, there are valid use-cases.

They are not less important, but in most cases, shared ownership is best avoided.


== rules of thumb when using `unique_ptr`

=== Avoid passing `unique_ptr` by const-ref

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
class bar{ /* ... */ };
// bad, forces the user to allocate bar on the heap,
// even if foo cannot use that information
void foo(const std::unique_ptr<bar>&)

// better
void foo(const bar*)

// even better if bar cannot/should not be null
void foo(const bar&)

// even better if bar is "small", like integral types, enums or small data structures, like string_view, span, ...
void foo(bar);
----

=== Pass by value to denote unconditional transfer in ownership

[source,cpp,tabsize=2]
----
class X {
		std::unique_ptr<int> i;
	public:
		explicit X(std::unique_ptr<int> ii) : i(std::move(ii)) {}
};
void bar(std::unique_ptr<int>);

void foo(){
	auto i = std::make_unique<int>(42);
	X x(std::move(i));
	bar(std::move(i));

	bar(std::make_unique<int>(42));
}
