== `auto`

In C and before {cpp}11, `auto` is used as a counterpart of `static`.

In practice it was never used, so the {cpp} comittee recycled the word for automatically deducing the type of a new object.

Contrary to dynamic languages like python and javascript, type deduction is done at compile time.

`auto` is especially useful for objects with a specific interface and factory functions, like the iterators

#include <vector>

std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3};
auto it = vec.begin();

and especially in templates

template <class C>
void print(const C& c){
  for(typename C::const_iterator it = c.begin(); it != c.end(); ++it){
    std::cout << *it << '\n';
  }
}

auto decays:

  * raw arrays convert to pointers
  * function converts to function pointers
  * top-level references are removed
  * top-level const/volatile qualifiers are removed

Those are the same rules that applies when passing or returning arguments by value.

auto str = "Hello World!"; 
// str has type const char*, while "..." is of type const char[13]
