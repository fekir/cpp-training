== `override`

Works similarly to other languages, like java


[source, cpp]
----
struct base {
	virtual void foo(unsigned int);
};
struct derived : base {
	void foo(unsigned int) override;
};
----

Triggers a compile-error if `base::foo` changes signature or is not `virtual` anymore.

=== `override`

Can be used for destructors too

[source, cpp]
----
struct base{
	virtual ~base();
};
struct derived : base {
	~derived() override;
};
----

As destructors cannot change signature, the advantage in this case is that in case `~base()` is not `virtual` anymore, instead of triggering UB, it's a compiler error.
